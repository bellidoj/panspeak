# Panspeak

Panspeak lets you write a text once and get a human readable version and a tts ready version with little effort.

# Usage

The differences between readable and tts versions have to be enclosed following this pattern

    #-WRITE VERSION|TTS VERSION-#

so if you have something like: 

        It is 2" wide 

you ended with:

        It is 2#-"| inches-# wide


that will give you:

-   readable version: It is 2" wide
-   tts version: It is 2 inches wide

 
# Version

## 0.2

-   Save As
-   Edit Menu to add marks (Ctrl + M).
-   Preferences men√∫ added. You can enable the tts conversion (lame required).
