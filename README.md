# Panspeak

Panspeak lets you write a text once and get a human readable version and a tts ready version with little effort.

# Usage

The differences between readable and tts versions have to be enclosed following this pattern

    #-WRITE VERSION|TTS VERSION-#

so if you have something like: It is 2" wide you ended with:

    It is 2#-"| inches-# wide

that will give you:

 -  readable version: It is 2" wide
 -  tts version: It is 2 inches wide
